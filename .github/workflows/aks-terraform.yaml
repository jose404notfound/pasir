    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout code
      # This step checks out the repository to access the Terraform configuration files and any other resources.
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Step 2: Set up Azure CLI
      # This step sets up Azure CLI to interact with Azure resources like AKS.
      - name: Set up Azure CLI
        uses: azure/setup-azurecli@v2

      # Step 3: Log in to Azure
      # This step logs into Azure using service principal credentials stored as GitHub Secrets. These credentials allow us to interact with Azure resources.
      - name: Log in to Azure
        uses: azure/login@v1
        with:
          creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}  # The service principal credentials from GitHub secrets

      # Step 4: Set up Terraform
      # This step installs the specified version of Terraform on the runner, which will be used to execute the infrastructure deployment.
      - name: Set up Terraform
        uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v1
        with:
          terraform_version: 1.0.5  # Specify the version of Terraform to use

      # Step 5: Terraform fmt (Format all Terraform files)
      # This step ensures that all Terraform configuration files are formatted correctly, making them more readable and consistent.
      # It recursively formats the files in the environment directory (dev, prod, etc.) based on the input environment.
      - name: Terraform fmt (Format all Terraform files)
        run: |
          terraform fmt -recursive ./terraform/environments/${{ github.event.inputs.environment }}

      # Step 6: Initialize Terraform
      # This step initializes the Terraform configuration, downloading the necessary provider plugins, and preparing the backend for managing state.
      - name: Initialize Terraform
        run: |
          terraform init ./terraform/environments/${{ github.event.inputs.environment }}

      # Step 7: Validate Terraform
      # This step runs `terraform validate` to ensure that the configuration files are syntactically correct and that all resources are properly defined.
      - name: Validate Terraform
        run: |
          terraform validate ./terraform/environments/${{ github.event.inputs.environment }}

      # Step 8: Terraform Plan
      # This step generates an execution plan by running `terraform plan`. It shows the changes Terraform will make to the infrastructure, which allows us to review them before applying.
      - name: Terraform Plan
        run: |
          terraform plan -out=tfplan ./terraform/environments/${{ github.event.inputs.environment }}

      # Step 9: Terraform Apply
      # This step applies the changes to the infrastructure by running `terraform apply` with the generated plan (`tfplan`).
      # The `-auto-approve` flag automatically confirms the plan, ensuring the deployment proceeds without manual confirmation.
      - name: Terraform Apply
        run: |
          terraform apply -auto-approve tfplan ./terraform/environments/${{ github.event.inputs.environment }}
